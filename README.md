Kenneth Le's No SQL-Challenge - Assignment 12


I did some incorrect coding and went back to the start of my code and re-ran. I eventually found out that this had caused my database to be filled up with duplicate entries with wrong data so I had problems until I found out I had to drop and delete my database to start from the top again. Doing this fixed most of my work and I had no further issues.
